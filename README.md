# Attention-Estimation-System

Project focuses on the development of an AI-Based Attention estimation system for classroom environment. The system aims to assess students' attentiveness based on facial emotions and gaze tracking data. By using deep learning techniques, we analyze video input from classroom cameras to generate insightful report on individual student attentivity.
